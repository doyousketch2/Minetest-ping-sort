YMMV.  Other factors may apply; including, but not limited to:  
- [x] Processor speed  
- [x] Available cores  
- [x] Hard drive speed  
- [x] FSB / Memory speed  
- [x] How many extra processes are running  
- [x] How many players are online  
- [x] How many mods are installed  
- [x] Texture sizes
